## üöß Model Development Journey: From Basic to Corrected

### **üìä Model 1: Basic Approach (Paygrade.ipynb)**
**Results**: R¬≤ ‚âà 0.25-0.30, MAE ‚âà $45,000

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Simple one-hot encoding** of categorical variables without domain knowledge
- **No interaction features** - missed complex relationships between variables
- **Basic feature engineering** - only log transformation of target variable
- **Limited preprocessing** - no handling of high cardinality features
- **Poor model selection** - focused on linear models without proper evaluation

**Key Issues:**
- Models struggled with salary distribution skewness
- Residual plots showed persistent heteroscedasticity (funnel shape)
- Feature importance was dominated by a few variables
- Predictions were unreliable for high-salary ranges

### **üß† Model 2: Deep Learning Focus (MLPaygrade_Model.ipynb)**
**Results**: R¬≤ ‚âà 0.25-0.30, MAE ‚âà $44,000

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Overemphasis on model complexity** rather than feature quality
- **Deep learning underperformance** - neural networks performed worse than simple models
- **Limited feature engineering** - only basic transformations
- **Poor hyperparameter tuning** - focused on architecture rather than data quality
- **Batch normalization issues** - didn't solve the underlying data problems

**Key Issues:**
- Deep learning models achieved R¬≤ = -0.5683 (worse than predicting mean)
- Complex architectures didn't improve performance
- Still had persistent residual patterns
- Feature engineering was insufficient

### **üîÑ Model 3: Iterative Improvements**
**Results**: R¬≤ ‚âà 0.30-0.35, MAE ‚âà $43,000

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Target transformation struggles** - log and Yeo-Johnson transformations didn't solve skewness
- **Feature engineering plateau** - diminishing returns on simple features
- **Model explainability gaps** - couldn't understand why models failed
- **Deployment complexity** - models were too complex for practical use

**Key Issues:**
- R-squared plateaued around 0.3 despite extensive experimentation
- Residual plots consistently showed heteroscedasticity
- Models struggled with high-salary predictions
- No clear path to improvement

### **üö® Model 4: Data Leakage Discovery (Initial Advanced Features)**
**Results**: R¬≤ = 0.9993 (99.93% - suspiciously perfect!)

**Critical Discovery:**
- **Initial results showed R¬≤ = 0.9993** (99.93% - suspiciously perfect)
- **Identified data leakage** in target-dependent features
- **Salary statistics by groups** were using the target variable
- **Feature importance dominated by leaky features** (59.7% total leakage)

**Data Leakage Sources:**
- `salary_percentile_by_title` (31.7% importance - leaky!)
- `job_title_mean_salary` (20.8% importance - leaky!)
- `exp_level_mean_salary` (4.7% importance - leaky!)
- `company_size_mean_salary` (0.3% importance - leaky!)
- `remote_premium` and `country_salary_premium` (leaky!)

**Advanced Feature Engineering Breakthrough:**
