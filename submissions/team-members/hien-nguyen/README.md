## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Report

This section synthesizes key findings and highlights from the full project report presented for advanced salary prediction in tech/data/AI fields.

### üîç Exploratory Data Analysis ‚Äì Key Insights

- *Salary by Role & Experience:*
  - AI/ML roles yield the highest median salaries; significant high-value outliers in ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù and some Data jobs.
  - Experience level strongly matters: Executives and Seniors earn most, while Entry roles are lowest; confirmed across years.
  - *Salary distributions* show substantial variability even within the same job title.

- *Remote Work Effects:*
  - Fully-remote (100%) roles can have higher outlier salaries but also a wide spread.
  - Executives working remotely see the highest median salaries.
  - Overall, remote ratio does not drastically lower salary.

- *Company & Geographic Variation:*
  - Medium companies tend to pay higher ($143K median) than large ($136K) or small ($71K).
  - North America offers the highest average salaries ($147K median), followed by Oceania and Europe, others much lower.
  - Location and job type clusters show tangible salary banding.

- *Job Title Consistency:*
  - Large variation across similar titles (e.g., Data Scientist vs Data Science Consultant).
  - Boxplots indicate wide interquartile ranges for most job categories.

---

### üèóÔ∏è Feature Engineering ‚Äì Main Strategies

- High-cardinality features (job_title, employee_residence, company_location) grouped via KMeans and continent mapping for manageability.
- All numerical features standardized; salary target log-transformed to stabilize variability.
- Engineered features: leadership level, experience-job type, experience-continent, job title popularity, clustering, GDP combination.
- Final input schema:
  - 4 ordinal features
  - 12 nominal features (types, geography, engineered interactions)
  - 2 numeric features (popularity, GDP)
  - *Imbalance found* in categorical features; handled via aggregate encodings and clusters.

---

### ü§ñ Modeling ‚Äì Comparison & Performance

- *Best Performing Models:*
  - Bagging Regression & Random Forest slightly outperform Neural Network and Symbolic Regression.
  - Ensembles (tree-based) capture non-linear and categorical relationships best for salary prediction.

- *Metrics Table (Log & USD scale):*

- *Symbolic Regression:*
  - Provides transparent, human-readable formulas for understanding salary drivers.
  - Slightly lower accuracy than ensembles, but far superior explainability.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Model Selection & Tuning ‚Äì Approach

- Neural network architecture: FFNN with 3 layers (128, 64, 32 units), ReLU + Dropout, log-salary target.
- Symbolic regression tuned with Optuna for equation simplicity and validation performance.
- MLflow used for tracking model architecture, hyperparameters, and all metrics‚Äîgood for reproducibility.
- Symbolic regression chosen for interpretability; ensemble chosen for best accuracy.

### üîó Explainability & Stakeholder Communication

- SHAP explanations presented in intuitive, field-level terms.
- Top feature impacts mapped to simple factors (experience level, role, location).
- Predictions are market estimates, not rigid guarantees; users are encouraged to interpret as guidance.
